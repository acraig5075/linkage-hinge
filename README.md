linkage-hinge
=============

Description
-----------

What I call a linkage-hinge is a way for a wooden box to have a lid that opens using linkages instead of a traditional mechanical hinge. The placement of these linkages is critical to whether the lid can open or if the movement is some how obstructed. This WPF application is to determine these positions for marking out on the real wood.

How to build
------------

Needs the [WPF Extended Toolkit](http://wpftoolkit.codeplex.com/) for the Integer up/down controls. Get that using NuGet and add to the project. Then build as normal.
